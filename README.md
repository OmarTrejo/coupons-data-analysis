# Will a Customer Accept the Coupon?

## Context

Imagine you're driving through town and a coupon for a nearby restaurant is delivered to your phone. Would you take a detour to use the coupon immediately? Would you save it for later or ignore it? What factors influence whether you accept the coupon? Is it the type of venueâ€”restaurant, bar, coffee shop? Does having a passenger, the weather, or the time of day make a difference? 

This project explores the factors that influence the likelihood of accepting a coupon delivered while driving.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior in response to driving-related coupons. We aim to explore how various factors, such as passenger type, weather, and destination, affect whether a customer accepts a coupon. Using visualizations and probability distributions, we aim to uncover patterns in customer decisions.

## Data Source

The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected through a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The dataset provides scenarios involving driving conditions (destination, weather, passengers, etc.), and participants were asked if they would accept coupons for various establishments, such as:

- Restaurants (less than $20)
- Coffee houses
- Takeaway places
- Bars
- Restaurants ($20-$50)

### Data Summary

Each record in the dataset represents a scenario where a coupon was offered. Responses to whether the coupon was accepted are labeled as:

- `Y = 1` for accepting the coupon either right away or later
- `Y = 0` for rejecting the coupon

### Key Attributes

1. **User Attributes**:
   - Gender, age, marital status, number of children, education level, occupation, income
   - Frequency of visits to bars, coffee houses, takeaway places, and restaurants (under $20)

2. **Contextual Attributes**:
   - Destination (home, work, or no urgent destination)
   - Location and proximity to the venue
   - Weather (sunny, rainy, snowy), temperature (30F, 55F, 80F)
   - Time (10AM, 2PM, 6PM), and passengers (alone, with partner, friends, or kids)

3. **Coupon Attributes**:
   - Type of venue (restaurant, bar, coffee house, etc.)
   - Time before the coupon expires (2 hours, 1 day)

## Analysis and Methodology

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values by either dropping or imputing data.
   - Cleaning and transforming the dataset for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualizations of acceptance rates by different coupon types and user characteristics.
   - Bar plots and histograms for factors like coupon type, temperature, and acceptance rates.

3. **Specific Investigations**:
   - Analyzing acceptance rates for bar coupons, comparing users based on bar visitation frequency, age, and presence of passengers.
   - Comparing acceptance rates for users going to bars more than once a month with different income levels or marital statuses.
   
4. **Independent Investigation**:
   - Examining characteristics of users accepting coupons for restaurants under $20, focusing on factors like income and age.

## Key Findings

### General Coupon Acceptance Rates
- The overall acceptance rate for coupons varies by type and context, with restaurants and coffee houses generally having higher acceptance rates than bars.

### Bar Coupons
- People who visit bars more frequently (more than 3 times per month) are more likely to accept bar coupons, especially if they are under 30 or have a partner as a passenger.

### Restaurants Under $20
- Users with an income below $50K and younger than 25 tend to accept restaurant coupons for less expensive meals more frequently.

## Conclusion

This project provides insight into how various factors influence the acceptance of driving-related coupons. The findings could help businesses tailor their marketing strategies by targeting the right customers at the right time and place.
